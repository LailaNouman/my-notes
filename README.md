### I am Laila Nouman I recently graudated from university of Jordan with a Bachelor's degree in  * Computer Information Systems *, I have a lot of hobbies like: cooking, singing, swimming, horse riding. I love to go on adventures and discover new things, hanging out with my friends and go on a rides, to watch movies and learn new things. I studied programming because i love mathmatical stuff and to solve problems. 


# Fundamentals of a good developers:

The purpose of software is to help people. Design of the system does matter because you want a software for a lifetime, the design should be easy for the developer and useful for others. The developer must understand the system fully and the tools he's working with because thats how you know you are a good or a bad developer. Complexity make your work take more time and your code have more bugs to fix and maybe you will rewrite your code from scratch. Maintenance is very important in software development. If you do something one way keep doing it in that way. Prioratizing and it comes in three factors:
- The desirability of a change (D)
- The value of a change (V)
- The effort required to perform the change (E)

The equation is: D=V/E. There are steps to solve problems first: understanding, second: planning, third: dividing. Dont start to think of every small detail, **Start small, improve it, then extend.** You cant predict the future so dont be too generic. Dont kill your project with assumptions. Don't reinvent the wheel. Don't answer to changing request by a **YES.** If you can automate it then automate it. Don't measure your software quality on code lines. Add your logging in early stage. **UNTESTED CODE IS THE CODE THAT DOESN'T WORK.** Don't underestimate the time and effort that is required to develop a code so you don't lead to miss the deadline. Remember To always consider refactoring first. Always write your comments to explain why and not what. Always document your software architecture, modules and components. Don't depend on external technologies. Don't stop from learning new programming languages, use different tools, read books about software development. It will make a real difference in your skills and knowledge. Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
