# my-notes

### I am Laila Nouman I recently graudated from university of Jordan with a Bachelor's degree in  * Computer Information Systems *, I have a lot of hobbies like: cooking, singing, swimming, horse riding. I love to go on adventures and discover new things, hanging out with my friends and go on a rides, to watch movies and learn new things. I studied programming because i love mathmatical stuff and to solve problems. 


# Fundamentals of a good developers:

The purpose of software is to help people, who cant understand the purpose of it will write bad. Design of the system does matter because you want a software for a lifetime, the design should be easy for the developer and useful for others. The developer must understand the system fully and the tools he's working with because thats how you know you are a good or a bad developer. A good programmer should make the code as simple as he can for other programmers. To write a complex code is not smart, complexity make your work take more time and your code have more bugs to fix and maybe you will rewrite your code from scratch. Maintenance is very important in software development. There will always be implementation of changes you will have to implement them and maintain them over time. If you do something one way keep doing it in that way. Code that isn't consistent becomes harder to understand. Prioratizing and it comes in three factors:
- The desirability of a change (D): How much do you want that change to happen?
- The value of a change (V): How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
- The effort required to perform the change (E): How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?

The equation is: D=V/E. There are steps to solve problems first: understanding. To know exactly what is being asked, write down the problem and try to explain it to someone. Second: planning. do not take actions fast give yourself time to analyze it and process the information. Third: dividing. Dont look at the problem as a whole, divide it into smaller tasks and solve each one by one then connect them. Dont start to think of every small detail, dont take assumptions and predictions, **Don't chase perfection.** Start small, improve it, then extend. You cant predict the future so dont be too generic because it will involve a code that isn't needed. Dont kill your project with assumptions. Don't reinvent the wheel. The only time it’s okay to reinvent the wheel is when:
- You need something that doesn’t exist yet.
- All of the existing “wheels” are bad technologies or incapable of handling your needs.
- The existing “wheels” aren’t being properly maintained.

 Don't answer to changing request by a **YES.** Always resist adding new things until you are convinced that they are required. When you realize that you are doing something again and again remember If you can automate it then automate it. Don't measure your software quality on code lines. You should keep your code base as small as possible. Add your logging in early stage. It will help you to save your time and find the problem easy. **UNTESTED CODE IS THE CODE THAT DOESN'T WORK.** Don't underestimate the time and effort that is required to develop a code so you don't lead to miss the deadline. 
Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases. Remember To always consider refactoring first. Always write your comments to explain why and not what. Always document your software architecture, modules and components, to see the high-level picture of your software. Don't depend on external technologies and when you have to try to minimize your dependency on them because they are another source of complexity. Consider these factors when you want to use a technology: 
- Is there active development behind it?
- Will it continue to be maintained?
- How easy is it to switch away from?
- What does the community say about it?

Don't stop from learning new programming languages, use different tools, read books about software development. It will make a real difference in your skills and knowledge. Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help. Don't ask about something you are not sure of. Try everything you can think of and if you can't then search, find answers and try them. If you did not get it then ask for an advice.
